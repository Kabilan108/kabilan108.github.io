**Hello there!**

I'm a Senior at Drexel University, completing the accelerated BS/MS in
Biomedical Engineering program with specializations in Bioinformatics, Neuroengineering,
and Biomedical Imaging. 

Right now, I'm working on exploring Retrieval Augmented Generation (**RAG**) and 
**Agent** systems leveraging large language models (**LLMs**). In particular, I'm 
exploring their applications in developing systems that leverage multimodal data to 
aid in providing **clincal decision support**.

I recently completed my final co-op working as a Data Scientist in the Non-Clinical
Safety group at GSK where I worked on developing machine learning pipelines for
analyzing biomedical imaging and spatial transcriptomics data.

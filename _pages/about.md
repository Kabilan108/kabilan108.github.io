Welcome! I am a Junior Biomedical Engineering major at Drexel University in the
BS/MS program with concentrations in Bioinformatics, Imaging and Neuroengineering.
I just completed a year working as a Bioinformatics Scientist co-op in the
Non-Clinical Safety group under the *In Vitro In Vivo Translation* department
at GSK.Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of data science and large-scale
multi-omics data analysis.

Currently, I am also completing the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera; I hope to apply my knowledge of deep learning towards developing tools for Spatial Transcriptomics and High-Content Imaging data analysis.

I am currently pursuing a combined BS/MS degree in Biomedical Engineering at Drexel. Some of my academic work from previous internships and research projects have been published.

I am also the Vice President of Drexel Computational Design where I have worked on various projects in collaboration with my peers.
